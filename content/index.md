        <h3>My name is Stefan!</h3>
        <p class="my-20">
            I'm a web development student 'with a twist'! After nearly a decade working as a process engineer and project manager, I decided it was time for a change... So here I am, diving headfirst into the world of coding and creativity. 😁 My journey has taken me through diverse industries and even some entrepreneurial adventures (ever tried to build a startup from scratch? I aged more from that than anything else... And that's coming from a dad).
        </p>
        <p class="my-20">
            When I'm not busy learning to become a web developer, I'm instead working a full-time job as a project manager at a consultancy firm. And when I'm not working at all, I spend most of my free time with my wonderful partner and 5-year-old son (he's a tiny tornado, but I love every minute of it! 🌪).
        </p>
        <p class="my-20">
            I'm passionate about continuous learning, bringing a fresh perspective and finding innovative solutions to every challenge. Now, I'm excited to combine my previous engineering background 👷‍♂️ with my new passion for web development and see where this journey takes me!
        </p>
        <p class="my-20">
            Looking forward to connecting, collaborating, and creating ✨magic✨!
